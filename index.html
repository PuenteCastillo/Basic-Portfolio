                    Hello World! A genius, billionaire, playboy philanthropist, are words I'd wish described me,
                    but I am simply a web developer with an overzealous imagination that has seen too many movies. I
                    develop websites both front and back end, dabble with AI, and prototype with 3D printers, but I
                    still don’t know how taxes work. I believe some of the best programming is done on paper, really.
                    Putting it into the computer is secondary. Google is my weapon of choice, but I also know some
                    JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C#, PHP, FML, and IDK.
                </p>
                <p>When I’m not coding I’m sleeping, and when I’m not doing either I’m filming. Yes, filming. Premier
                    Pro and After Effects are my guilty pleasure, as well as photoshop. I use film and photography in
                    my creative process and link them into my websites whenever possible. I’m a big believer in showing
                    a story rather than telling one, film and photography allow me to do that. Gaming is also a hubby
                    of mine, and I mean creating games not playing games. I find creating a game is sometimes more fun
                    than the actual game. Now if you’re looking for a web developer with a lot of time in his hands hit
                    me up, or if you just want to hang out, I’m down too. </p>
